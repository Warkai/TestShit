                 <p>    Luke Skywalker: Oh, no! We'll never get it out now!
                    Yoda: So certain, are you? Always with you, it cannot be done. Hear you nothing that I say?
                    Luke: Master, moving stones around is one thing, but this is... totally different!
                    Yoda: No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn what you have learned.
                    Luke: All right, I'll give it a try.
                    Yoda: No! Try not. Do... or do not. There is no try.</p>
